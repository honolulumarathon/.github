The first race of the weekend is the Kalakaua Merrie Mile which kicks off at 7 a.m. on Saturday. It’s a one-mile race in Waikiki followed by a beach party.

The 26.2-mile course kicks off on Sunday at 5 a.m. on Ala Moana Boulevard with a firework show. Marathon officials said no one else can pickup your race bib for you and it can’t be done the day of the race.

The course goes through downtown Honolulu, past Iolani Palace and the Christmas lights, through Waikiki and climbs up and around Diamond Head, before heading out through Kahala and out to Hawaii Kai. Turning back after Hawaii Kai toward Kahala and Honolulu, the course passes Diamond Head again on the ocean side before finishing in Kapiolani Park.
